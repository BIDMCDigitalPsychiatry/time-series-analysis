| Assessing the Effectiveness of LSTM Deep Learning Models as Predictors of Structured Survey Scores: PANSS and SFS Scores in Schizophrenia | LSTM_RNN_PANSS_SFS_Score_Prediction.ipynb | This Jupyter notebook loads in forward filled data from the SHARP dataset containing active, passive, and structured survey data. It preprocesses the data for time series analysis, creates RNN and LSTM models, trains the models on a training subset of the data, and evaluates performance using KFold cross-validation on a test subset of data. |
